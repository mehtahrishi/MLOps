# MLOps Learning Roadmap üöÄ

This roadmap is designed to help you learn **MLOps** from scratch, even if you only know the basics of Python. It's broken down into **5 stages** that build upon each other.

## üìö Stage 1: Strengthen Core Skills (Python + ML Basics)

**Goal:** Get comfortable with Python scripting and understand the basics of Machine Learning (ML).

### ‚úÖ Learn:
- **Python Basics**: Loops, functions, libraries, and handling files
- **Data Science Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- **ML Basics**:
  - Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning
  - Regression, Classification, Clustering
  - `scikit-learn` for model training

### üîß Tools:
- Jupyter Notebook
- Google Colab (for free GPU/TPU)
- `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Stage 2: Learn ML Model Lifecycle + Experiment Tracking

**Goal:** Understand how to train, evaluate, and track ML models.

### ‚úÖ Learn:
- Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
- Model Training, Evaluation, and Tuning
- **Experiment Tracking**: Track model parameters and metrics
- **Version Control** for models and data

### üîß Tools:
- `MLflow` for tracking experiments
- `DVC` for versioning data and models

---

## üöÄ Stage 3: Model Deployment Basics

**Goal:** Deploy a simple ML model as a web API.

### ‚úÖ Learn:
- **Flask** or **FastAPI** to serve models
- How to create RESTful APIs
- How to serialize and serve models using `joblib` or `pickle`

### üîß Tools:
- Flask or FastAPI
- `joblib` or `pickle` for saving models
- Postman for testing APIs

---

## üê≥ Stage 4: MLOps Foundations (DevOps + Automation)

**Goal:** Learn the DevOps side of MLOps, including automation and CI/CD pipelines.

### ‚úÖ Learn:
- **Git** and GitHub for version control
- **Docker** to containerize ML models and applications
- **CI/CD** pipelines using **GitHub Actions** for automating training and deployment

### üîß Tools:
- Git + GitHub
- Docker for containerization
- GitHub Actions for automating workflows

---

## üìà Stage 5: Monitor & Retrain in Production

**Goal:** Implement monitoring and retraining of models in production.

### ‚úÖ Learn:
- **Monitoring Models**: Accuracy, performance, and data drift
- **Automated Retraining**: Automatically retrain models when performance drops

### üîß Tools:
- MLflow or Weights & Biases for model monitoring
- **Cron Jobs** for scheduled retraining
- **Logging** and alerting

## üíª Suggested Mini MLOps Project

**"House Price Predictor with MLOps"**

1. **Train** a regression model to predict house prices (use `scikit-learn`).
2. **Save** the model using `joblib` or `pickle`.
3. **Create a Flask or FastAPI API** to serve the model and predict house prices from user input.
4. **Dockerize** the model API and push it to a container registry.
5. Set up **GitHub Actions** to automate testing, building, and deploying the model.
6. **Track experiments** using `MLflow`.
7. Optionally, **monitor the model** in production for data drift or performance degradation.
